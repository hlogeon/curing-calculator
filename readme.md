# Curing Calculator

This is a simple web-based curing calculator designed to help with the process of curing meats. The calculator allows users to input various parameters such as the weight of the meat, percentage of salt, sugar, spices, and nitrite in the curing mixture, as well as the diameter of the meat piece. Based on these inputs, the calculator computes the required amounts of each ingredient and provides an estimate of the curing time needed for the meat to fully cure.

## Features

- Calculate the required amounts of salt, sugar, spices, and nitrite for curing meats.
- Estimate the curing time based on the diameter of the meat piece.
- Input parameters in grams for easy calculation.
- Provides results in grams for accurate measurement.

## Usage

1. Open the curing calculator webpage in a web browser.
2. Enter the weight of the meat in grams, the percentage of salt, sugar, spices, nitrite in the curing mixture, and the diameter of the meat piece in centimeters.
3. Click the "Calculate" button to see the results.
4. Review the computed amounts of each ingredient and the estimated curing time.

## How it Works

The curing calculator uses JavaScript to perform the calculations based on the user inputs. It takes into account the weight of the meat, desired percentages of salt, sugar, spices, and nitrite, and the diameter of the meat piece. The calculator then computes the required amounts of each ingredient and estimates the curing time needed for the meat to fully cure.
